A specification and implementation of the Quite Ok Image Format (https://qoiformat.org/qoi-specification.pdf) in Dafny.

The folder ```Functional``` contains a verified implementation of the QOI format using (mostly) immutable data structures. This is a proof of concept that will work too slowly on anything but the smallest inputs.

The folder ```Imperative``` contains a verified imperative implementation using (mostly) arrays. This implementation is reasonably fast. To build and run the executable:

```
    dafny translate cs --include-runtime --unicode-char:false entry.dfy
    dotnet run <inputfile>
```

(you will need .NET installed on your computer)

If the inputfile ends in ```.rgb```, it is converted to ```.qoi``` and vice-versa.

To simply verify the development:

```
    dafny /vcsCores:8 /timeLimit:15 /trace helper.dfy spec.dfy specbit.dfy qoi.dfy
```
